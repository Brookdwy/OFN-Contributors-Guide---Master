# Graphical resources

We have not yet properly defined the graphical charter of the OFN, but we can already share some elements. We are going to refine that graphic base step by step.

### Fonts

The font use for the logo is \[to be specified\].

The font we use for titles and paragraph texts are \[to be specified\].

### Color code

The colors we use are the following : \[to be specified\].

### Visual elements of the logo

Here is a [vectorial version of a basic OFN logo](https://drive.google.com/open?id=122tCLq00EoDOtJH4s7p53n7AI1pLxnEl). You can use it to build your local brand.

### Powerpoint templates

Here is [a template of a powerpoint we have been using lately](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lLM2IL-95xlFYE26XaYzOaNGlsQfeuoyhUODPglj0pI/edit?usp=sharing). You can reuse it for local presentations or adapt it to your local branding.



Please try as much as possible in your local communication to respect those graphical elements, so that we can have some global consistency around our image.
