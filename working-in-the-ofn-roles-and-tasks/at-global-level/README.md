# At global level

On the global scope, the common we share for now is the OFN code base. So we have built a team and process to maintain and develop that common.

You can contribute at that level on all what is related to the code base \(development, UX, test\) and also "product owner" \(make sure the evolution of the product is driven by user needs and satisfy those needs\) and "train driver" \(process curation\).
