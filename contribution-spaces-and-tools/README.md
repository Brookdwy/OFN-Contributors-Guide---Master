# Information management

There are three levels of information flow:

* **Level 0 = any person interested in the OFN,** they need to easily find information on what is OFN.
  * They are supported by the local and global communication teams through the following channels:
    * General information website
    * Affiliates newsletter
* **Level 1 = hubs' customers**, they need to buy without friction. Ideally the UX of the marketplace is clear enough so no documentation is needed. Some hubs have developed tutorials for their customers who have difficulties to use internet tools.
  * Hubs' customers are supported by hub managers through the following channels:
    * Tutorials
      * their home made tutorials \[we can share some to hub managers on which they can build their own custom version\]
      * Online video tutorials = Youtube OFN UK channel
    * Personal reactive support = most hubs give at least an email so their customers can email them, sometimes a phone number as well.
* **Level 2 = hub managers**, they need to know how to use the OFN ressources \(software, knowledge\). On the software side, they need to know how to create and manage their hub on the OFN platform.  
  * Hub managers are supported by affiliates managers through the following channels:
    * Documentation = user guide
    * Personal reactive support = ticketing tool / support email. No live chat yet
* **Level 3 = local OFN affiliates managers**, they need to know how to develop their local entity and community, structure it legally, economically and operationally. They are providing the services based on the OFN ressources : Saas service based on the OFN software, training and consulting based on OFN sector development resources, etc. They need to be able to support the development and performance of the hubs, while using the software or through supporting them in their business and operational models. 
  * Unexperienced / new affiliates managers are supported by experienced managers through the following channels:
    * Documentation = OFN handbook \(including OFN software super-admin handbook\) and Google drive for coedition of documents and storage.
    * Personal reactive support = OFN global email hello@openfoodnetwork.org
    * Dynamic forum = Community forum \(category "using OFN", tag "Community of practice"\)
    * Live chat = Slack \(channel "customer service" \[to be renamed something like "Affiliates support"\]\)
  * Experiences affiliates managers are supported by the product developers \(web developers for the software, researchers and content creators for sector development knowledge\)
    * Dynamic forum = Community forum \(category "software improvement" and "community of practice" \[rename "sector development resources improvement"?\]\) and Google drive for coedition of documents and storage.
    * Ticketing = Github for software issues \(label "bug"\), Airtable for sector development resources issues.
    * Live chat = Slack \(channel "bugs" and "devs"\)
* **Level 4 = products developers**, 
  * Software product developers
    * Documentation = Github Wiki and OFN handbook
  * Sector development resources developers
    * To be defined
