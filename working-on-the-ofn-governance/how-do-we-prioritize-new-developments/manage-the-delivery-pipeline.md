# Manage the delivery pipeline

Lots of different issues compete to enter the delivery pipeline:  
- stories from selected feature candidates story maps  
- bugs  
- tech debt issues reported by developers

In order to feed the delivery pipe to ensure the sustainability and maintainability of our product, we need to make sure that tech debt is taken into account, and that bugs get solved. For that we have set up a rolling curation team composed of 2 devs x 2 product people + a facilitator.

**The role of this curation team is to decide what enters the pipeline for the quarter to come**:  
- what tech debt do we need to fix?   
- among the TOP10 needs how many do we feed into the delivery pipe?  
- what bugs do we put as dev ready for occasional/new developers?

Train drivers are then in charge of making the plan happen!
