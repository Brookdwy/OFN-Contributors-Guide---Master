# Curate the delivery pipeline

So we will have in permanence lots of different issues competing to enter the delivery pipeline:  
- features answering prioritized unmet needs  
- bugs  
- tech debt issues reported by developers

In order to feed the delivery pipe to ensure the sustainability and maintainability of our product, we need to make sure that tech debt is taken into account, that painful bugs get solved and that prioritized unmet needs get met. For that we have set up a **rolling curation team composed of 2 devs x 2 product people + a facilitator.**

**The role of this curation team is to decide what enters the pipeline for the quarter to come:**  
- what tech debt do we need to fix in this quarter?  
- among the features selected to satisfy the unmet needs, which ones can we reasonably incept and implement in the quarter to come?  
- what bugs do we put in the pipeline as dev ready for occasional/new developers?

The curation team will then share a roadmap for the quarter to come that the global product team will then be in charge of implementing. For new features answering unmet needs, that means proceed them to inception and implementation.
