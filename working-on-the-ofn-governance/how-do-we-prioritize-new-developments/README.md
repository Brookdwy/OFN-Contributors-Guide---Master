# How do we prioritize new developments

We don't talk about bugs, here, bugs preventing to use existing features are treated differently. Here we talk about _****_**needs expressed by users and which are not yet satisfied by the platform**.

The process here follow three steps:  
1- Needs collection and understanding  
2- Needs priorization at instance level  
3- Needs priorization at global level = our roadmap for the months to come

Some users sometimes express their need as an "emergency need". We invite instance managers to question why it is an emergency. **In OFN we consider as emergencies only bug severity 1 and 2 that really prevent users to use the platform**. For a new need not yet satisfied, if you consider it is an emergency, you can always call a priorization process to invite instances to review the priority list given the new information you provide.
