# Record needs expressed by users

When a need that is not currently satisfied by the software is reported by a user, the local instance support team / product owner will record that need into a "needs feeds" \(to be specified: where is it done, in which tool and under which process\).

**WARNING:** usually users will tend to express requests for specific features and won't explain clearly the need behind it. It is the responsability for the local instance PO to discuss with the user to understand the underlying need, and express that need in a structured way.

\[TO BE DONE:  
- today we have a big wishlist, which is a mix of features request without expression of a clear need  
- we also have a bunch of icebox items which are structured expression of a need  
- I propose to get read of the "wishlist concept" and just only accept needs to enter the process, so that every actor HAS to do the job of understing and expressing the need.  
- and to rename "icebox" something that convey better the fact that this is a need that is waiting to be prioritized. Why not simply call them "needs?" We record in a structured way the needs that are unmet at the moment.\]
