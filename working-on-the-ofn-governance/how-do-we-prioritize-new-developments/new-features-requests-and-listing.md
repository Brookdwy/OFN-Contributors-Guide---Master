# Report, understand and prioritize needs

How do we process needs **reported by users that are not yet satisfied by the platform?**

### **1- Needs collection and understanding**

When a need that is not currently satisfied by the software is reported by a user, the local instance support team / product owner will record that need into a "needs feeds" \(to be specified: where is it done, in which tool and under which process\). You can use the [following template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hLDAiRIHUKlDd7CBTd7qIeQnATjg-VaymqnflE_rnBg/edit?usp=sharing) to help you in this task.

**WARNINGS:** Users will tend to express requests for specific features and won't explain clearly the need behind it. It is the responsability for the local instance PO to discuss with the user to understand the underlying need, and express that need in a structured way.

### **2- Needs priorization**

Lots of OFN users in different countries express different needs. So how to decide which need we address first?

**a- Short term process**

Each instance will have their way to discuss with their users and decide together with them what are the top priorities for that instance. **So every quarter, every instance will have to list the 10 top priority needs they would like the OFN to cover, ordered from the most important to the less important.**

As every instance do that, we then need to decide among all those priority needs which one we all agree to start with. Every quarter at a minimum, and upon request if needs be, **the curation team will host a "pitching session" where every instance representative is invited**. Participants to that session will be invited to propose what should be priority 1 and why, until one proposition get the consent of all participants. We then do the same for priority 2, etc. until priority 10. That way, **the OFN will always have TOP10 priority list that constitutes our roadmap for the months to come**.

This process needs to be **adaptative**: we do that every quarter, but if something important happens and might result in modifying this priority list, any instance representative can launch again a priorization process to review the TOP 10 priority list.

**b- Longer term possibilities**

On a longer term we might use a tool that would enable users to directly vote on their most important pain point so they would need anymore an instance representative to convey their priorities in a global curation process.

### 4- About "emergency needs"

Some users sometimes express their need as an "emergency need". We invite instance managers to question why it is an emergency. **In OFN we consider as emergencies only bug severity 1 and 2 that really prevent users to use the platform**. For a new need not yet satisfied, if you consider it is an emergency, you can always call a priorization process to invite instances to review the priority list given the new information you provide.

\[TO BE DONE:  
- today we have a big wishlist, which is a mix of features request without expression of a clear need  
- we also have a bunch of icebox items which are structured expression of a need  
- I propose to get read of the "wishlist concept" and just only accept needs to enter the process, so that every actor HAS to do the job of understing and expressing the need.  
- and to rename "icebox" something that convey better the fact that this is a need that is waiting to be prioritized. Why not simply call them "needs?" We record in a structured way the needs that are unmet at the moment.\]
