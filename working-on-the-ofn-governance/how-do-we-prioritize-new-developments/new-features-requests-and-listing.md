# Report, understand and prioritize needs

How do we process needs **reported by users that are not yet satisfied by the platform?**

### **1- Needs collection and understanding**

When a need that is not currently satisfied by the software is reported by a user, either the user or the local instance support team / product owner will record that need into the "wishlist" category on Discourse. You can use the [following template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hLDAiRIHUKlDd7CBTd7qIeQnATjg-VaymqnflE_rnBg/edit?usp=sharing) to help you in this task. \[we can create a discourse template for the "wishlist category"!!!\] 

Most of the time, the reporter of the need will not have all info when they start the discussion about this new need. So until the need is fully specified, it remains in "wishlist category". When discussions move on, the curators of the discussion will update the main post to always keep the up-to-date the specification of the need. When the curators think the need have been clearly understood and well reported, they can change the category to "unmet needs". 

\[we need a team of wishlist curators... we have 140 wishlist items and we need to process them, either say they have already been answered, or are captured in an icebox item today, so close them. Either if not yet in our icebox items start processing them the way we suggest in new process. We can rename icebox to "unmet needs"\]

**WARNINGS:** Users will tend to express their needs as solutions or features \("I would like a new button here that will let me do this thing..."\) and won't explain clearly the need behind it \("I'm having trouble finding this thing and it's one of the most frequent things I do"\). It is the responsability of the local instance PO to understand the underlying need, and express that need in a structured way.

### **2- Needs priorization**

Lots of OFN users in different countries have different needs. So how to decide which need we address first?

**a- Current process**

Each instance will have their way to discuss with their users and decide together with them what are the top priorities for that instance. **So every quarter, every instance will have to list the 10 top priority needs they would like the OFN to cover, ordered from the most important to the less important.**

All the "unmet needs" that have been carefully investigated and understood are then in this "unmet need" category. We are testing the Discourse plugin that enable to vote on them, we are not sure it will do the job, but we are trying! \[Maybe we can ask Discourse team to improve their feature if we need? Might cost us less thant trying to use another tool maybe... we can maybe contribute to their improvement if close to our need...\]. The idea is that every instance representative will have 10 votes to allocate to unmet needs each quarter.

We then need to use those lists to set global priorities. Every quarter at a minimum, and upon request if needs be, **the curation team will host a "pitching session" where every instance representative is invited**. Participants to that session will be invited to propose what should be priority 1 and why, until one proposition get the consent of all participants. We then do the same for priority 2, etc. until priority 10. That way, **the OFN will always have TOP10 priority list that constitutes our roadmap for the months to come**.

Those TOP 10 global prioritized unmet need will be recorded in [https://community.openfoodnetwork.org/t/top10-priority-needs-evolution-process/1389](https://community.openfoodnetwork.org/t/top10-priority-needs-evolution-process/1389) \[shall we have like releases, versionning of priority list shared each time a new revision have happened?\] or in Milanote?

This process needs to be **adaptative**: we do that every quarter, but if something important happens and might result in modifying this priority list, any instance representative can launch again a priorization process to review the TOP 10 priority list.

**b- Future possibilities**

On a longer term we might use a tool that would enable users to directly vote on their most important pain point so they would need anymore an instance representative to convey their priorities in a global curation process.

### 4- About "emergency needs"

Some users sometimes express their need as an "emergency need". We invite instance managers to question why it is an emergency. **In OFN we consider as emergencies only bug severity 1 and 2 that really prevent users to use the platform**. For a new need not yet satisfied, if you consider it is an emergency, you can always call a priorization process to invite instances to review the priority list given the new information you provide. Or if circomstances change in a specific instance that justify to review our top 10 priority list, you can also call a new priorization process.

\[TO BE DONE:  
- today we have a big wishlist, which is a mix of features request without expression of a clear need  
- we also have a bunch of icebox items which are structured expression of a need  
- I propose to get read of the "wishlist concept" and just only accept needs to enter the process, so that every actor HAS to do the job of understing and expressing the need.  
- and to rename "icebox" something that convey better the fact that this is a need that is waiting to be prioritized. Why not simply call them "needs?" We record in a structured way the needs that are unmet at the moment.\]
