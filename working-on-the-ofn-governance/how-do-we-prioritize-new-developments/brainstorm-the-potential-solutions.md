# Identify feature candidates and select one

When we have this TOP10 needs identified, we need to organize brainstormings about the potential solutions that could enable us to satisfy the need.

Every need will be assigned to a "product owner" and a "tech owner". They are responsible to organize the brainstorming process that encompasses:  
- listing all the possible solutions to answer the need. Those potential solutions are called **"feature candidates"**.  
- evaluating for each of them the easyness level and value level, and map the feature candidates in a **value/ease matrix**  
- choosing the feature candidate that enable us to get enough value to meet the need, and that will request the less work for that. This feature candidate is then called **"selected feature candidate"**.
