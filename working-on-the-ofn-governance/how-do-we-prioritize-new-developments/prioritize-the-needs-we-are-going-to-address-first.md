# Report and curate bugs

There is no software without bugs. We just need a process to report and fix bugs efficiently. Not all bugs are equivalent, some really prevent the use of the platform and should be addressed as soon as possible. Others are small bugs that are not really annoying, we can live with them, users may not even have noticed them.

### **1- What is a bug?**

We regularly have people opening issues on Github saying they are bug, but in fact they talk about a new feature not yet implemented. Bugs are only gaps between how a feature is supposed to work ALREADY, and how it works ACTUALLY.

### **2- What to do if you identify a bug?**

Open an issue on Github. When you create an issue, you will see a default template guiding you to report that bug. We have worked on a [five level priority list](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/wiki/Bug-severity), please always affect a priority level to a bug, that will help us curate them!

### **3- How do we curate bugs?**

The train drivers of the OFN will treat the new bugs the following way:  
a- Every new bug is added to the project board "[Bug management](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/projects/23)", in the backlog column.  
b- The train driver will make sure the solution is clear enough. If an inception is needed to clarify the job to be done, they will place it in the "inception column". Else they will put it to the dev ready column and order them by severity and within a same severity level, by priority.  
c- They will make sure there are always the 3-4 top priority bugs in the "deav ready column" of the delivery pipeline so that developers know they can pick them up.  
d- For s1 or s2 bugs, as soon as the bug is reported, they will add a mesage on the \#dev channel on Slack to make sure the first developer available work on it as soon as possible.
