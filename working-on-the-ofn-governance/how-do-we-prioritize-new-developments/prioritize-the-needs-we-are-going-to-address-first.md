# Prioritize the needs we are going to address first

Lots of OFN users in different countries express different needs. So how to decide which need we address first?

**1- Short term process**

Each instance will have their way to discuss with their users and decide together with them what are the top priorities for that instance. So every quarter, every instance will have to list the 10 top priority needs they would like the OFN to cover, ordered from the most important to the less important.

As every instance do that, we then need to decide among all those priority needs which one we all agree to start with. Every quarter at a minimum, and upon request if needs be, the curation team will host a "pitching session" where every instance representative is invited. Participants to that session will be invited to propose what should be priority 1 and why, until one proposition get the consent of all participants. We then do the same for priority 2, etc. until priority 10. The idea is that we always have a TOP10 priority list.

This process needs to be adaptative, so at least we do that every quarter, but if something important happen and might result in modifying this priority list, any instance representative can launch again a priorization process with instance top 10 listing and pitching.

**2- Longer term possibilities**

On a longer term we might use a tool that woudl enable users to directly vote on their most important pain point so they would need anymore an instance representative to convey their priorities in a global curation process.
