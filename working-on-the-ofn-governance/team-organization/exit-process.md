# Exit process

As contributors can become certified, join the Core Team, and start getting paid for their contributions, if they don't play by the collaboratively admitted rules, they will step out from the Core Team and stop being paid for their contributions.

This can happen under the following circumstances:  
- **the contributor did commit to dedicate a certain amount of time, but doesn't meet their commitment and doesn't notify the rest of the team**. Because of that, the project move slower than expected, which put the project at risk.  
- **there is a tension due to lack of communication that really prevents the team to work together efficiently**. That prevents the team from being efficient. That apply to occasional contributors as well.  
- **there is a technical lack of skills in the contributor's domain that we didn't see during the certification process**, and the contributions of that contributors doesn't really create any value for the OFN. We can't afford to pay for contributors who don't create any value. That apply to occasional contributors as well.

## How do we moderate the exit process?

There are two ways that can happen:  
- **either the contributor step out themselves** as they realize they don't do the job properly, or don't manage to work on a regular basis as they expected.  
- **either they don't, and then it is the responsability of another Core Team member to notify the other Core Team members about the tension they feel with that specific contributor.** That will generally be done via a private Slach channel. Discussions can happen until we reach a lazy consent about an exclusion of the contributor from the certified team, or from the Core Team. An exclusion from the certified team means the contributor can't invoice anymore any contribution. An exclusion from the Core Team means the contributor can still invoice occasional contributions, and can ask again to join the Core Team if they can work again on a regulard basis.

## I am certified and part of the Core Team, what if I just can't work anymore on a regular basis on OFN?

The contributor can themselves step back of being part of the Core Team if they see they can't work on a regular basis on OFN anymore. They will then automatically be considered as "Certificied occasional contributors". They can still do some work for the OFN, but only on punctual things that the global team has offered for occasional contributors to work on. If their life circumstances change again and they can commit again to work at least 1 day per week on the OFN, they need to apply to become again a "certified regular contributor" as the global team need to check if budget allows to pay them for the time they want to commit in the months to come.
