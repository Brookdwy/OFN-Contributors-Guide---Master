# Exit process

As contributors can become certified, join the Core Team, and start getting paid for their contributions, if they don't play by the collaboratively admitted rules, they will step out from the Core Team and stop being paid for their contributions.

This can happen under the following circumstances:  
- **the contributor did commit to dedicate a certain amount of time, but doesn't meet their commitment and doesn't notify the rest of the team**. Because of that, the project move slower than expected, which put the project at risk.  
- blabla
