# How do we process selected feature candidates till release?

When a feature candidated has been selected for a given need, the "product owner" for the need is in charge of opening an epic on Github and add it to the "product feature backlog" project board in the "backlog" column.

The feature enter now a process where it is going to be **incepted:** we go more deeply to understand the technical constraints, the user flows, how the feature would look like \(mockups\), etc. and together with products and devs people we list all the small stories \(issues\) that needs to be done until we consider the feature as "done". Those stories will be ordered in what we call a **"story map"**.

When we have this story map, the train drivers will feed the delivery pipeline with new issues picking them in those story maps, in order to make sure the features are released as quickly and efficiently as possible.
