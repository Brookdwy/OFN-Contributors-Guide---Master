# How do we curate what enters the delivery pipeline?

Lots of different issues compete to enter the delivery pipeline:  
- stories from selected feature candidates story maps  
- bugs  
- tech debt issues

In order to feed the delivery pipe to ensure the sustainability and maintainability of our product, we need to make sure tech debts are taken into account, and that bugs get solved. For that we have set up a rolling curation team composed of 2 devs x 2 product people + a facilitator.

**NOTE**: emergency bugs have a specific process and enter the delivery pipeline without having to go through the curation team approval.
