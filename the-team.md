# The team

As we explain later in this guidebook, people can contribute on the local level \(building a local OFN community\) or at global level. At global level, we are building a team of certified contributors, who have gone through the onboarding process. Some are paid contributors, other can afford and have chosen to remain volunteers contributors, but all people in the certified team are involved on a daily basis.
