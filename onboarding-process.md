# 1- How to join the community

OFN is a community with contributors in different countries, who work as peers, without any hierarchical relationship. Bu default, the organization is "liquid", people can join and start contributing, some contribute a little bit for a very short time, some really commit and for them OFN becomes their main daily occupation. 

Contributors create value for the OFN commons, whether it be by contributing with pieces of code, with communication initiative, or with fund raising. The logic we aim to achieve is to be able as a community to retribute the contributors for the value they bring to the community. But before creating value, a new contributor most of the time needs support. The supporters create value for the community by helping out newcomers of course, and we are all happy to invest in the development of the community.

But we are still a small group of people and have limited capacity \(24 hours per day, and some other things we want to do in our life :-\)\) Unfortunately, we can't afford to spend a lot of time with people who are not able, after a certain period of time, to efficiently create value for the project. And we can't afford either to pay those people...  

SO to try and become more efficient in onboarding new contributors, we are piloting this brand new process! The idea is to give you some steps that you can follow to try to reach to the point where you can be a "certified contributor" and start charging the community for your time \(under certain conditions defined here\) Feel free to give us any feedback. 



a-New contributors  
When a new dev is interested by the project,**the first step, before they can be paid for his contribution, is to start contributing on a volunteer basis**. The purpose of this is:

* to enable the dev to understand from inside what it is to work on OFN and see if that’s what they wants
* to enable them to get to a point where they can start to create real value for the project \(which would justify being paid\)
* to enable the rest of the dev team to gauge if skills fit to what the project need, in term both of technical \(coding abilities\) and social \(communication abilities\) skills.

  So any new dev need to start picking some issues and committing some first PRs.

\#\#\#b-Certified regular contributors  
After that, a developer who wants to be paid in order to be able to really invest time on the project can request to be certified. When they are, they will be able to invoice contributions.  
To be certified, the dev must meet three conditions:

* **Have the tech skills required**
  in order to make sure that they deliver real value for the time paid for. The other devs can gauge that based on the first contributions of the dev. If they think some important tech skills are missing, they can orient the dev to some issues where they will be able to learn the missing crucial skills.
* **Have the communication skills required**
  in order to make sure no paid time in inefficiencies due to lack of communication, and ensure a global consistency of the team and processes. That means he has to be part of the Slack conversations in the
  \#dev
  channel, reply to questions on GH, give feedbacks and review to contributors, ask questions as soon as something is not clear to get a consent with other devs on how to solve an issue, participate to speccing sessions, etc.
* **Dedicate at least one full day per week on the project**
  , in order to make sure that the certified devs are commited and engaged, and that if they take an issue they are going to deliver quickly and don’t block the processes. It doesn’t have to be every week the same day, and can be like 2 half days.

\#\#\#c-Certified occasional contributors  
For now, the project really needs committed and engaged developers, but on some issues occasional contributions can also help to make things move faster. So in case this is needed, devs who have**both the tech and communication skills**but can’t commit to a regular contribution basis can request to be certified as occasinal contributors and be paid for their contributions. In that case,**they will be offered by the global product team to take some specific issues**and will be paid for those contributions. Any other contribution they make on their own initiative will be considered as volunteer contributions.
