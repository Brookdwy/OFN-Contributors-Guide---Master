# The roles

There are many different ways to contribute to the OFN project. Inspired by the holacracy model, we differentiate the people from the roles they can do for certain periods of time. A person can have multiple roles, and a role can be fulfilled by many persons. Some roles relate more to an instance level. Others more to a global level. Some needs to be done at both levels, like communication for instance.

## At local level \(local OFN entity & community\)

### Organizing the Saas service on the OFN software
